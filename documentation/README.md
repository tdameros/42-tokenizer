## Wallet.sol

Wallet42 is a multi-signature wallet implementation that requires multiple confirmations to execute transactions. Designed for secure fund management with shared ownership.

### Contract Details
- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.20+

- Transaction execution after sufficient confirmations
- Prevention of duplicate confirmations

### Core Functions

#### submitTransaction(to, data)
Submits a new transaction for confirmation  
Restricted to: Wallet owners

#### confirmTransaction(transactionIndex)
Confirms a pending transaction  
Restricted to: Wallet owners  
Requirements:
- Transaction must exist
- Not yet executed
- Not already confirmed by caller

#### executeTransaction(transactionIndex)
Executes a confirmed transaction  
Restricted to: Wallet owners  
Requirements:
- Sufficient confirmations
- Not yet executed

#### View Functions
- getOwners(): Returns list of all owners
- getTransactions(): Returns all transactions

### Events

#### Transaction Lifecycle

- SubmitTransaction: When new transaction created
- ConfirmTransaction: When owner confirms transaction
- RevokeConfirmation: When owner revokes confirmation
- ExecuteTransaction: When transaction executes

### Configuration

#### Constructor Parameters
- owners: Array of owner addresses
- numConfirmationsRequired: Minimum confirmations needed

#### Requirements
- At least 1 owner required
- Confirmations required must be > 0 and â‰¤ owner count
- All owners must be unique, non-zero addresses

### Usage

#### Initialization
Deploy with owner addresses and confirmation threshold

#### Typical Workflow
